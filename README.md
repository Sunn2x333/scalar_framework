## Overview

This repository accompanies the paper:

> **"Scalar Field as Information Bridge: Environmental Modulation of Boundary Dynamics Across Scales"**  
> by **Bobby Davis (2025)**

The project explores a unifying scalar field framework (`φ`) that acts as an *information substrate* linking microscopic and cosmological processes.  
It demonstrates how gradient coupling between physical boundaries can explain:
- Neutron lifetime discrepancies  
- Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) abundance variations  
- Gravitational screening and structure formation  
- Scalar-induced lensing correlations

All computations are performed through modular Jupyter notebooks, reflecting a bottom-up reconstruction of scalar-mediated boundary interactions.
